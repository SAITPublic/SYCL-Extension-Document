# Experimental Extensions

This directory contains the specifications for SYCL extensions that are supported for the Samsung Computational Memory device. These specifications have implemented in DPC++ (SYCL in Intel). The implementations in these extensions can not be stable. 



To create html/pdf from the ASCIIDoc format, you can get some help from https://docs.asciidoctor.org/pdf-converter/latest/install/.
When you use the Windows system, this link (https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/issues/2) would be helpful.



You can check the implementations by referring to the table below.
